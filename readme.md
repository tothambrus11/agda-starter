# Agda Starter Project

This project contains development container config files which make it easier to set up Agda.

## Requirements:
 - Docker
 - VSCode
 - _Dev Containers_ VSCode extension 

## Getting Started
1. Create a copy of this template (`Use this template` - green button on the top right in GitHub)
2. Clone your repository into a local folder.
3. Open the folder in VSCode
4. Make sure docker has already started on your system
5. Execute the `Reopen Folder in Container` action (either by clicking on the popup button or in the `Ctrl + Shift + P` menu).
6. Enjoy!

## Useful Shortcuts
Interpret `C-c C-l` as hitting `Ctrl+c`, then `Ctrl+l`
- `C-c C-l`: Load and type-check current file
- `C-c C-n`: Evaluate expression (normalize)
- `C-c C-d`: Infer type of exression

Don't forget to reload the file by `C-c C-l` after you make changes before using other commands.
